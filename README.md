# Model


This repository contains the implementation of Extra Trees Classifier model, a machine learning model designed for high performance and efficiency. The model is trained on spaceship titanic dataset and aims to predict the accuracy in terms of passenger transportation.Various experiments were done using different models such as random forest (RF), logistic regression, KNeighboursClassifier, Support Vector Classifier(SVC), Gaussian NB, Perceptron and Decision tree.

Finally we implement the TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool), an automated machine learning (AutoML) tool designed to automate the process of selecting the best machine learning pipelines for a given dataset.
