# Preprocessing data
 
This repository provides a collection of preprocessing steps. These preprocessing techniques are essential for cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data before feeding it into machine learning models. By standardizing and preprocessing the data effectively, we can improve model performance and ensure reliable predictions.

Some of the preprocessing steps we used are:

Imputation - This preprocessing step is crucial because missing values in a dataset can cause issues for machine learning algorithms during training.

One-hot encoding - One-hot encoding is a process of converting categorical variables into a numerical representation that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering - It is the process of creating new features or transforming existing features in the dataset to improve the performance of machine learning models.
