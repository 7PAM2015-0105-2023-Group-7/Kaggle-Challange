EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. The primary goal of EDA is to understand the data and the relationships between its features, detect patterns, anomalies, and trends, and formulate hypotheses for further investigation.
